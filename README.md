# Java-Snek
I'm making the Snake game in Java under 24 hours completely from scratch. I have no knowledge of anything I'm going to be using for this thing and I'm learning as I go.

# Result:

Took more like 48 hours of working with a lot of breaks in between because I could not block out my personal life. But the thing is done, in a very barebones form at least. There is now a green square that goes around the entirety of the screen and it eats a red square. I haven't been able to covert the .JAR file to a proper .EXE file because of issues with the wix toolset. but it works if you download the java file and run it on a Java compiler. 

It uses no additional packages - it's been made completely on native Java. I would love to juts release the .EXE file in the near future but as of now, I'm moving on to brighter pasteurs. 

Fun project though.
